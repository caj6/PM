# Projection mapping

## Interactive Projection Mapping

### Overview

This project integrates Blender 3D rendering with real-time face detection using OpenCV and an Intel RealSense camera to create an interactive holographic projection mapping system. The system dynamically adjusts virtual windows on objects based on the observerâ€™s position, enhancing the illusion of looking through a real window into a virtual world.

### Features

- Blender 3D Integration

 * Clears previous objects and imports 3D models.

 * Ensures the model fits within a designated holographic cube.

 * Applies emissive noise textures for a flickering, dynamic effect.

 * Uses a strategically placed camera and lighting system for optimal projection alignment.

- OpenCV & Intel RealSense Face Detection

 * Captures real-time video using an Intel RealSense camera.

 * Detects and tracks human faces using deep learning-based models.

 * Analyzes position data to refine image alignment in Blender.

 * Adjusts the holographic projection dynamically based on the observerâ€™s viewpoint.

- Real-Time Adjustments & Performance Optimization

 * Utilizes CNN-based face detection for high accuracy with minimal latency.

 * Leverages holography transformations for precise projection alignment.

 * Implements multi-threading for high frame rates and smooth, responsive effects.

## System Architecture

### Blender Scene Setup

* Import and position the 3D model.

 * Apply emissive textures for a holographic effect.

 * Align the camera and lighting for accurate projection.

### RealSense Face Detection

 * Capture video streams in real-time.

 * Process frames using CNN-based face detection.

 * Extract face position data for dynamic adjustments.

### Projection Alignment

 * Calculate observer position and adjust the projection.

 * Optimize rendering for minimal lag and smooth visualization.
